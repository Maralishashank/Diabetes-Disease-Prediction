Diabetes Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning

I implemented a full-stack web application that predicts whether a person is likely to have diabetes using 
machine learning techniques. The main objective was to learn how to apply data science concepts in a real-world 
healthcare use case and integrate them with a web-based user interface.

I started by studying the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset, which contains medical attributes such as pregnancies, 
glucose level, blood pressure, skin thickness, insulin, BMI, diabetes pedigree function and age. Using Python and 
the scikit-learn library, I trained multiple classification algorithms including K-Nearest Neighbour, Naïve Bayes, 
Decision Tree, Random Forest and Support Vector Machine. The dataset was split into training and testing sets and 
the accuracy of each model was evaluated. I also used cross-validation to ensure that the models generalize well.

After comparing the results, the best performing model was selected and saved as a file using joblib. This model is 
loaded by the backend whenever a new prediction is required. For the web layer, I used the Django framework. I 
created forms to collect patient details, views to process the input and call the ML prediction function, and models 
to store each prediction in the database. The frontend is built using HTML and CSS to give a clean and responsive UI.

Finally, I integrated everything so that when a user fills in the form and submits it, the system displays whether the 
person is at high or low risk of diabetes along with a confidence score. Through this project, I applied concepts of 
machine learning, Python programming, database handling and web development in a single solution, which improved my 
understanding of end-to-end full stack application development.
